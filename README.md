## Rapyd Tips

Here are some tips to help you make the most of Rapyd 👍🏻

### Lists

A simple `-` can be used to create simple unordered lists:

- item
- item
- item

Or you can use numbers and `.` to create ordered lists:

1. item
2. item
3. item

### Emoji

By pressing `ctrl + cmd + space` on Mac or `Windows key +.` on Windows, you can open the dialog box that allows you to insert emojis inside the text that are useful for formatting your notes 📝

### Dividers

You can use `-` to create dividers for different sections of your notes:

`-----------------------------------------------------------------------`

### Commands

You can use the browser's native commands to perform a series of quick operations:

🖨 `cmd + p` or `ctrl + p` to print or save as pdf

💾 `cmd + s` or `ctrl + s` to save in HTML format

🔍 `cmd + f`or  `ctrl + f` to search for something within the note

### Organization

There are many ways you could use Rapyd. For example, when you create a note you can insert the current date in the first line and save the notes in HTML format based on the day.

You can create a folder to save the various notes in HTML format. Opening the file you will find the note perfectly editable. After making a change, save the note with the same name in the folder to avoid duplicates.
